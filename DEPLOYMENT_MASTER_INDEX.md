## 🏗️ Universal Architecture

All three cloud providers use the **same logical architecture**:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Browser   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ HTTPS
       ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Frontend (Next.js) │  ← Dashboard for deploying instances
└──────┬──────────────┘
       │ API calls
       ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Backend (FastAPI)   │  ← Orchestrates MemMachine deployments
└──┬─────────────────┬─┘
   │                 │
   │ Creates         │ Stores metadata
   ▼                 ▼
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│ MemMachine   │  │  PostgreSQL  │
│ Instance     │  │  Database    │
│ + Neo4j Aura │  └──────────────┘
└──────────────┘
```

**Key Insight:** The application code is **identical** across all clouds. Only infrastructure commands differ.

## 🔑 Critical Discoveries

### The psycopg2 Problem (SOLVED)

**Problem:** MemMachine's official Docker image lacks PostgreSQL support.

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'`

**Solution:** Install psycopg2 to the exact location where MemMachine's virtual environment expects it:

```dockerfile
RUN /usr/local/bin/python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir \
    --target=/app/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages \
    psycopg2-binary
```

**Why this works:**
- MemMachine uses a symlink-based virtual environment
- `/app/.venv/bin/python` → `/usr/local/bin/python3` (symlink)
- Python's `sys.path` includes `/app/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages`
- Installing to system Python doesn't work (wrong location)
- Runtime installation is too slow (MemMachine starts before it completes)

**This discovery took 6+ attempts and is the KEY to successful deployment.**

### Neo4j Aura Integration (NEW)

**Improvement:** Use Neo4j Aura (managed SaaS) instead of self-hosting Neo4j.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No VPC networking complexity
- ✅ No infrastructure management
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Lower cost ($0-65/month vs $100+/month)
- ✅ Better reliability and performance
- ✅ Works identically across all clouds

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "neo4j_uri": "neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io",
  "neo4j_user": "neo4j",
  "neo4j_password": "YOUR_AURA_PASSWORD"
}
```

### PUBLIC IP for Databases (NEW)

**Change:** Use PUBLIC IP instead of PRIVATE IP for database connections.

**Rationale:**
- PRIVATE IP requires VPC connector ($80/month on GCP)
- PUBLIC IP works immediately with no additional infrastructure
- Security is maintained via authorized networks + SSL
- Significant cost savings for small deployments

**Implementation:**
```python
# In database.py
ip_type="PUBLIC"  # Changed from "PRIVATE"
```

## 🐛 Universal Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'"

**Solution:** Rebuild Docker image with correct psycopg2 installation (see DEPLOY_*.md)

### Issue 2: Can't connect to database

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Check database is running
# GCP: gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE
# AWS: aws rds describe-db-instances
# Azure: az postgres flexible-server show

# Check network rules allow connection
# GCP: Check authorized networks
# AWS: Check security groups
# Azure: Check firewall rules
```

### Issue 3: Container won't start

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
# Check logs
# GCP: gcloud run services logs read SERVICE_NAME
# AWS: aws ecs describe-tasks
# Azure: az container logs

# Common causes:
# - Missing environment variables
# - Wrong database credentials
# - Port mismatch
# - Insufficient memory
```

### Issue 4: Neo4j Aura connection failed

**Solution:**
- Verify URI format: `neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io` (no port, no bolt://)
- Verify username: usually `neo4j`
- Verify password: from Neo4j Aura console
- Test connection independently before deploying

### Issue 5: Frontend can't reach backend

**Solution:**
- Verify backend URL is correct in frontend environment
- Check CORS configuration in backend
- Verify both services are in same network or publicly accessible
- Test backend API independently first
